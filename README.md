# Altspace_VR

  The main file is altspace_project.html.  You will also need to download the js files and place them in a "js" folder. Place the "js" folder in the same directory as altspace_project.hmtl. Finally open altspace_project.html in a web browser.  

  Once the html page has loaded if you place the mouse over one of the small cubes then the big cube will move. The idea is in VR the user would look at one of the small cubes and this would make the big cube move.  I wasn't able to test the user focus without a VR system so I used the mouse hovering instead. To make the big cube move, rotate, or scale in the opposite direction click the "Negative Transformation" check box.
  
  Thanks for your time,
  Tony
